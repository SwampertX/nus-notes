Points-to analysis

Constraints:

ANYTHING = &ANYTHING
ESCAPED = *ESCAPED
ESCAPED = ESCAPED + UNKNOWN
*ESCAPED = NONLOCAL
NONLOCAL = &NONLOCAL
NONLOCAL = &ESCAPED
INTEGER = &ANYTHING
x_3 = x_1
x_3 = &NONLOCAL
x_1 = &NONLOCAL
x_1 = x_3

Collapsing static cycles and doing variable substitution
Building predecessor graph
Detecting pointer and location equivalences
Rewriting constraints and unifying variables
Uniting pointer but not location equivalent variables
Finding indirect cycles
Solving graph

Points-to sets

ANYTHING = { ANYTHING }
ESCAPED = { ESCAPED NONLOCAL }
NONLOCAL = { ESCAPED NONLOCAL }
STOREDANYTHING = { }
INTEGER = { ANYTHING }
x_3 = { NONLOCAL }
x_1 = { NONLOCAL } same as x_3
