\problem{1}
Devise a mutual exclusion algorithm for \emph{n} processes by using
\emph{Peterson's 2-mutual-exclusion algorithm} as a black-box.
\solution
Intuitively, we create a ``tournament bracket'' for the processes, and for each
pair in the ``bracket'', the processes are promoted to the next level using
\emph{Peterson's Algorithm}.

Formally, we have the processes as leaves in a binary tree, and for each
non-leaf node in the tree, its value is the ``winning'' process among its
children, chosen by \emph{Peterson's Algorithm}.
