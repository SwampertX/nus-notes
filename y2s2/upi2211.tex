\section{Week 6 Monday}
\label{sec:orge807332}
\subsection{More's Utopia: Foreign Politics, War and Morals in Utopia}
\label{sec:orgff63ad2}
\subsubsection{Foreign Politics}
\label{sec:org36e1b85}
\begin{itemize}
\item Idealism
\begin{itemize}
\item Human nature is a treaty by itself, humans are united via feelings and
emotions
\item And it is more effective than treaties
\end{itemize}
\item Cynicism
\begin{itemize}
\item Giving rewards to people who kill the enemy king, as loyalty is impossible and
people only care about themselves
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Policies}
\label{sec:orgb449fa9}
\begin{itemize}
\item Do not involves citizens in foreign wars
\begin{itemize}
\item Only on a voluntary basis
\item Unless Utopia is invaded, then people are tasked to defend
\item Send whole families to war instead, boost morale
\item Compare to ``international army'' who fight for others causes
\end{itemize}
\item Tolerant of religious plurality
\begin{itemize}
\item However disallows/looksdown on atheists
\item All religions held in a same church - everything is common to all religions
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Discussions}
\label{sec:orgef34807}
\subsubsection{Warfare: hypocrisies and contradictions}
\label{sec:org25023fa}
\begin{itemize}
\item Utopians hire Venalians to fight for themselves
Problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item ``Utopians do not care how many Venalians they send to their deaths'' (p.94)
\item They don't care if Venalians are enticed by money to fight one another
\item Saying that Venalians are ``naturally designed for war'' prevent Utopians to
question the moralities of their policies
\item Double standards on the value of human life, regarding Utopians and Venalians
\item Can they always be the richest country?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Group discussion questions}
\label{sec:org0cf27ec}
\begin{itemize}
\item Are these policies what More thought was the ideal manner of interstate behavior?
\begin{itemize}
\item Is this Thomas More or Morus? Probably Thomas More
\item Are they ideal? Probably in a efficiency sense, but does it go against their morals?
\item Their reasons for going to war are quite petty
\item Utopia is built on a practical rather than a moral objective
\begin{itemize}
\item For example, religion + afterlife is to regulate moral behaviors
\item Did he want to eliminate the class system? Probably not(?)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Is a non-contradictory utopia possible? Efficient == moral?
\begin{itemize}
\item Not killing civilians is a efficient/moral way of waging war.(less lives lost) But reasons for waging war might not be moral
\item Impossible. Why?
\begin{itemize}
\item There is just so much you can control. Things can never be absolutely equal
\item There will always be tradeoffs? Also, what is moral then may not be moral now (ie no freedom of choice to live life)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Is Utopia satiric? If so, why did he still alternate between possible and satiric policies?
\begin{itemize}
\item He wants people to think about his policies
\item Blurs the line between utopia and dystopia - good place and noplace
\item Cover up what he really thought with ridiculous ideas?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{document}
