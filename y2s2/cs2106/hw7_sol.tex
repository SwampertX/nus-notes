I shall first present the solution, and then prove its correctness.

\section{Solution}
For the implementation without count:
\begin{minted}{py}
  mutex1 = Semaphore(1)
  mutex2 = Semaphore(1)
  notFull = Semaphore(K)
  notEmpty = Semaphore(0)
  in=0
  out=0
\end{minted}

For the one with count, the declarations are already given in the slides.
It is just the above code snippet with the below:

\begin{minted}{py}
  count = 0
\end{minted}

\section{Proof of correctness}
\begin{prop}
  We claim that this initialization, with the implementation rids the program
  of:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Race Condition
    \item Deadlock
    \item Starvation
    \item Indexing error
  \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof} (correctness)
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item {
        Race condition is eliminated by the semaphores \verb|notFull| and
        \verb|notEmpty|.

        Mutex2 guards against multiple consumers consuming at once, while
        Mutex1 prevents multiple producers producing at once.

        Two threads can fetch and write to the buffer concurrently, but we
        have the following constraint:
        \[ in \geq out \]

        To show this, we note the following properties:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item The circular buffer can be thought of as an infinite buffer
            (due to the wraparound property), and with an active window of
            maximum width \verb|K|.
          \item $in \geq notEmpty \geq consumersRan \geq out$
        \end{enumerate}

        The buffer has an active window of at most K since at most K items
        can be produced before producers are blocked. For each item consumed,
        exactly one producer is allowed to produce, giving us the invariance:
        \[ \#items = 0 + produced - consumed \]

        In a producer thread, \verb|in| is incremented before notEmpty is
        signalled. Since both are initialized to 0, we must have
        $in \geq notEmpty$.

        But also consumers can only run if not blocked by the \verb|notEmpty|
        semaphore, thus the second inequality.

        The \verb|out| variable is incremented only if a consumer thread is ran,
        and that gives us the last equality.
      }

    \item {
        Deadlock occurs if two semaphores are 0 at the same time, namely
        \verb|notEmpty| and \verb|notFull|.

        This is impossible in our case since we have invariance:
        \[ notEmpty + notFull = K \neq 0 \]

        If a producer (consumer) is called, it first decrements \verb|notEmpty|
        (\verb|notFull|), and eventually increments \verb|notFull|
        (\verb|notEmpty|). Thus we have the invariance.
      }
    \item {
        Starvation occurs if one process perpetually does not get to run. This
        does not happen because of the invariance in the previous bullet point,
        and as long as one thread runs, it allows an opposing thread to run.
      }
    \item {
        Indexing errors are guaranteed not to happen even if mutexes 1 and 2
        are different, given by an inequality we showed before:
        \[
          in \geq notEmpty \geq consumersRan \geq out
        \]

        Alongside with the property that the "infinte buffer" has an active
        window of at most K, no overwrites can happen. Since $in \geq out$,
        the window cannot be of negative length, ie the consumer will not
        be consuming empty item.
      }
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
