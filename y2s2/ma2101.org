* Week 7 Monday Lecture
** Definition
Let A and B be two n \(\times\) n matrices over the field \(\mathbb{F}\). We say
B
*is similar to A over \(\mathbb{F}\)*
if there is an invertible n \(\times\) n matrix P such that
\(B = P^{-1}AP\)
Moreover, by Theorem 2.8.2, if A and B represent the same linear operator T,
then they must be similar.
** Proposition: The determinant of a linear transformation
Let \(T:V\rightarrowV\) be a linear operator. Let \(\mathcal{}\)
