# Freedom and Responsibility
### Moral responsibility
S does X; X has a moral status (acceptable/unacceptable).
S is wholly responsible for X if they have **freewill**.
Ie. if S could have not done X, but still did it -> have to bear moral responsibility

### Laplace's Demon
Let's introduce a theory: the present is a cause of the past, and similarly the future is merely a consequence of the present (and the past). It is universal and exceptionless.
- If there had been intellect who has perfect knowledge down to the smallest atom (all of them)
- He must have been able to predict **without fail**, the future
- We call that intellect Laplace's Demon.
- In other words, what happens at the present is inevitable, and **MUST** happen without a tinest fraction of doubt.
#### This is called *Causal Determinism*

### Some other Determinism theories
#### Fatalism
- Some events are destined to hapen no matter what we do.
- When we try to avoid those outcomes, the act of escaping itself brings us to the destiny. (Similar to the Merchant of Baghdad).

#### Divine Foreknowledge
- God knows what will happen in the future, since what is known is also true
- It's not possible for the future to be otherwise than what God knows.
- Premise: there is a God

### Tension: Determinism vs Free Will
Consequential argument
1. Determinism is true. Our acts are the consequence of (1) the laws of nature and (2) what happened in the remote past.
2. We cannot decide what had been done before we were born.
3. The laws of nature cannot be violated.
4. Thus
