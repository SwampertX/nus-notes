## Three movements of a stroll
### 1. Zeno's paradox
    Most would consider this false, but it drew serious intellectual attention for many, many years...
### 2. Standard argument (against moral responsibility)
    A logical argument, and conclusion, but is hard to believe this all the time (and live like this!)
### 3. Compatibilism / Semi-compatibilism
    More friendly to our pre-inquiry notions, but might appear too good to be true...


### Some takeaway lessons.
1. Attitude: why are people even bothered about zeno's paradox? Why do the greeks think the world is not ultimately mysterious?
    - a curious attitude gives us the starting point to investigate the world.
    - the world exists for us to know; intellectual pursuit is a distant result of this faith buried, unknown.
2. History: they determine who we are; and they do matter.
    - we exist here for a reason; for a series of intended actions and accidents, and it does not make us any better.
3. A sampling of the philosopher's methods - case examples and logic
4. Pure reason vs knowledge: there are powers, along with limitations.
