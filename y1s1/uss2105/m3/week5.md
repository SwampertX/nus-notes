### Standard Argument and arguments against it:
- Usually we reject 3, but philosophers usually reject 2
- Compatibilism: The world is not deterministic, thus we have free will, thus we have moral responsibility.
- Semi-compatibilism: The world is not deterministic, but we have moral responsibility. By the way free will is not relevant, let me show you an example when someone doesn't have free will, but is still responsible for his actions.

### Frankfurt Case
- It's voting time. I usually vote for A instead of B - in fact I am a supporter of A. Suppose someone from A planted a device that'll force me to vote for A if I am thinking otherwise. On the day, I voted for A, as usual.
- Questions:
    1. Do I have a choice? (No)
    2. Am I responsible for voting A? (Yes)
- There you go: you don't have free will but is still responsible

### Ability Retention Argument
- If the universe is deterministic, we couldn't have done otherwise, for both things that we are able to (like swimming) but can't right now, or you never could (eg reverse gravity).
- You don't lose the abilities when you don't possess them - you still have the **free will** to do those things (go swimming) if you really wanted to.
- If you don't, you are obstructed.


- You are either obstructed because "it's too hot, i think i should spend more time with my housemates..." - own desires, empathy etc
- Or you are obstructed by determinism - alien/external force (tied up and forced to stay wherever you are and can't swim)

- all the free will you need to be morally responsible, is the amount of free will you have in a deterministic world. (so say the compatibilists)
