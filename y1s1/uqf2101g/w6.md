### Presentation Time!!
#### Probability of severe nuclear accident in the next year
- Everything can be estimated by a cost, just that it could be hard to be estimated
- Recall magnitude = log(A/A0) where A0 is a reference value.
- You can create your own scale!
- When you use regresssion to get out lambda, use a few models (eg. linear with logarithmic)
- This will result in an upper & lower bound on the predicted value.
- Why not just include expected time of recurrence (tau?)
