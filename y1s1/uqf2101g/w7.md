### Difficulties so far
1. Looking at a huge range - use log (scale)
2. Randomness, rare events - rate, model (empirical, mechanistic)
3. Complex construct (eg. "nuclear accident") - operationalization
4. (Upcoming) Too large a population - sampling
5. (Upcoming) Small effect - Hypothesis testing

### Variables!
- There are 2 types: qualitative(categorical), quantitative(numerical)
- Qualitative - Nominal (eg. marital status: single, married, divorced, widowed) and Ordinal (eg. level: low, medium, high)
- Quantitative - Discrete and Continuous
- Let's try to categorize some variables!
    - INES (ordinal, just a label)
    - Core damage (yes/no, binary which is nominal)
    - Generation of NPP (nominal? ordinal? up to discussion)

### Now we describe a dataset.
- Mean: arithematic mean. 
- Median: middle observation (position). Can be extended to ordinal variables.
- Mode: most common value.
- Above are all attempting to describe the dataset in a number. Any other attempts?
- Maximum, minimum, midrange, range

### Time to plot. Excel exercises
- use Mean(), Mode(), Median() for the named functions
- create a data column, create a bin column, selected a 3rd column with same number of rows as bins, type in =Frequency(data, bins) and C-Shift-Enter to get a histogram-ready column.
- Histograms: frequency histogram vs density histogram
- When bins get small, frequency histograms will have many zero bins.
- However density histogram's height = frequency/width, so when width goes to zero, the height doesn't.
- In other words: the count is encoded in height for freq, and area for density.
