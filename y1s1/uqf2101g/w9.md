## Lesson 1
### Recap last lesson
- Different types of sampling: random and non-random
- Choose random typically due to cost and logistics reason
- Choose non-random if you know extra info about population which will allow a representative sample
- Estimating population using sample: we look at the distribution of sample means
- Precision of the sample mean approximating population mean increases with sample size.

### Variance of sample vs population
- var( sample mean distribution ) = population var / sample size
- standard error = sqrt( var(m)) = sigma/sqrt(n)
- as sample size go large, mean distribution approximates the normal distribution (Central Limit Theorem), whose mean is the pop mean, and variance, pop variance / sample size.

### Recap strategy
1. Get some samples, and calulate their (insert quantity here).
2. Their (quantity) form a distribution.
3. Calculated the expected value of the sample (quantity), and compare it to the population (quantity). Are they the same? (ie. is it unbiased?)
4. (not rigorous) are they ways to tweak it (eg. divide by n-1 for variance)?

### Revisit the age-old question. What quantity is unbiased?
- Check mean, median, range, stdev, variance.
- Mean is automatically unbiased. Variance is unbiased after tweaking.
- Check: Stdev can't be tweaked, since the sqrt of sum != sum of sqrt.
- However, when sample size is large, stdev is acceptable (ie. stdev.p approximates stdev.s)
