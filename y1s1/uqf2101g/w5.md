### Recap from last week
- We started with 3 assumptions: constant rate, no simultaniety (for a given unit), no memory (events are independent)
- We started of with a lambda(day), which then the prob in the next day = lambda(day)
- To predict t days, we obtained prob = 1 - (1 - lambda)^t where t and lambda have units inverse of each others
- My limiting the time unit to as small as possible, we obtained ```prob = 1 - exp(-1 * lambda * t)```
- expected recurrence time is denoted by ``` tau = 1 / lambda```, and prob when time = tau is ```constant = 1 - exp(-1)```
#### An extension to nuclear decay
- recall that (N/N0) = (0.5)^(t/ half-life). 
- LHS is the proportion of undecayed nuclei, is related to probability of not decaying since prob = (desired events)/(total no of events)

### This week: predicting a rare event (with virtually no data)
- Precise question: how do we predict an earthquake >8?
- Answer:
