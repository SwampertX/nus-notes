### Is radiation harmful?
- We look at Hiroshima and Nagasaki dataset: absorbed dose vs no of deaths.
- How do they get the absorbed dose? By distance to epicentre
- Other factors? Shielding, Duration, Distance
- "background" death rates need to be considered too
- How to calculate expected death rates? Other factors eg. age, gender. Data for this comes from the census.
- observed deaths is a sample value, while expected death is a population value.
- Comparing the observed and expected: is the difference a significant result/correlation or is it just noise?
- That is the aim of Chapter 5.

### Hypothesis testing
- p-value: probability of ovserving a sample mean at least as extreme as given = p(z<-z) + p(z>z)
- confidence interval - not designed to test hyp, but used to do so
- z-value: without probability, similar to p-value
- chi-squared test - (obs-exp)^2 / exp as the kai-2 value, compared to a kai(1)distribution
- discrepancy = noise-signal, noise goes away as sample size increases
- adding categories eg ways of dying to the data, you can possibly change the result.
- it's a slippery slope! we can manipulate the result this way to our wanting.
