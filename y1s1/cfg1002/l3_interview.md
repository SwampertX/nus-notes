# Aceing the interview

### Interview formats
1. 1-to-1 interview (usually first round)
2. Panel Interview (sometimes group)
3. Phone interview (treat every communication as a potential interview!)
4. Skype Interview

### Organize yourself
1. Scheduling - Don't change the date anyhow!
2. Directions - consider get there once before, especially industrial parks
3. What to bring?

### Background research
1. How can you add value by doing certain jobs (not asking them about jobs)
2. Their business model, challenges
3. What differentiates them from their competitors
4. **Mr/Mrs, you have worked in the company for n years, what are some of the challenges you face?**

### 3 Main types of Questions
1. Personal Narrative
    * Tell me about yourself.
2. Have you done your homework
3. Why did you do so and so?
4. Hypothetical - ethics (what would you do?)
5. Curveball questions - eg. how many traffic lights are there in Singapore?

### 3 techniques to answer questions
1. Past-Present-Future
2. 3-point method (Omne Trium Perfectum)
3. STAR - Situation, Task, Action, Result

### \[insert some questions to ask (and not to ask)\]

### Interviewing Etiquette
1. Handphone on airplane mode, out of sight
2. Don't stare at the interviewer(s) - look at theirforehead instead if needed
3. Avoid questions on salary and benefits
4. Follow up with a thank you email!
5. Mirroring - the interviewer's gestures
6. Nothing is worse than a limb handshake!
7. Consider some more special colors than white - light/dark blue, grey, yellow/peach are possible

### My selection of harder questions to prepare
1. How did you overcome a difficult situation?
    - Maybe think of it as "What is the most challenging part of your internship/ commitment/ event?"
2. Have you shown leadership in a team project?
3. What interests you in this/previous job? (make sure to hit the important part of the job rather than secondary requirements)

#### Common Pitfalls & DOs
1. Don't answer too quickly - take some time to think
2. Practice likely questions, but not too unoriginal
3. Don't over/under answer, don't ask about a secondary part of the job
4. Prior Preparation and Planning Prevents Poor Performance
5. Treat everyone (eg. receptionist) well! Politely and professionally.
6. Prepare your own questions (at least 5!) "absolutely imperative, otherwise frustrating"
7. Research the company, department, interviewer
8. Check the news for any growth plans, mergers, new products etc
