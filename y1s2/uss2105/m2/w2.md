# Week 2: Peeking into Nature and Seking out Reality
- This course is a intersection of Philosophy (of Science), physics and mathematics.

### What is reality?
- is dream reality? if not, why not? why do our bodies still react to it (eg sweating profusely)? We felt it clearly. Can we trust our senses to distinguish reality with something else?
